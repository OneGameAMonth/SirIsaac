{"tagline":"Flash platformer featuring Sir Isaac Newton and his love for delicious apples. This is my January 1GAM entry.","note":"Don't delete this file!

This game is a platformer featuring Sir Isaac Newton himself, and his love for apples. The game is pretty small, and I had to cut a handful of features I wanted to add to work on other projects.\r\n\r\nThe game is built on top of Noel Berry's Advanced Platforming Engine (APE) for FlashPunk. The Isaac Newton sprite is from opengameart.org, while the parchment paper graphics are from openclipart.org. All of the classical music is from royaltyfreemusic.org. The sounds are mostly from freesound.org. Please feel free to use the code as you wish. If you do use any of the other assets please give credit where credit is due.\r\n\r\n-Eric Bernier","name":"SIr Isaac's Apples","google":""}
